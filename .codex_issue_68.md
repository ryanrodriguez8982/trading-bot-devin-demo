# Issue #68: Portfolio & Position model (cash-only, spot)

---

Implement a Portfolio model for cash-only spot trading. Tracks cash balances in quote currency, per-symbol positions with average cost, realized PnL, and total equity. Provide buy(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0) and sell(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0) methods.

Sells must be rejected if qty exceeds current position and cash may never go below zero. Fees are deducted from cash on buys and from proceeds on sells.

Backtester and live loop should use this model instead of ad-hoc logic. Add tests verifying cash/position updates, realized PnL, equity calculation, and invariants (no leverage, no shorting, cannot sell unowned).

CLI: allow configurable default trade_size (fractional allowed) and optional fee_bps parameter. Document flags in README or --help.
