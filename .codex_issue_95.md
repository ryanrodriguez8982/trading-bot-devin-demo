# Issue #95: Portfolio & Position model (cash-only, spot)

---

Implement a Portfolio/Position model for spot-only trading:
- Track cash (quote currency), positions per symbol with qty and avg cost, realized PnL, and equity.
- Methods: buy(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0), sell(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0).
- Guards: refuse sells if qty > position qty; never reduce cash below zero.
- Fees deducted from cash on buys and from proceeds on sells.

Integration:
- Backtester and live loop use this model instead of ad-hoc logic.
- CLI supports configurable default trade_size (fractional allowed) and fee_bps.

Tests:
- Buying reduces cash by cost + fees, increases position.
- Selling disallows more than held; valid sells reduce position, update cash, record PnL.
- Equity = cash + sum(position_qty * last_price).
- Invariants: no leverage, cannot short, cannot sell unowned.
