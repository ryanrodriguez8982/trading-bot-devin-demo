# Issue #70: Portfolio & Position model (cash-only, spot)

---

Implement a simple portfolio and position model to support spot-only trading:

- Track cash in the quote currency, positions per symbol with average cost,
  realized PnL and total equity.
- Methods: `buy(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0)` and
  `sell(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0)`.
- Guards: reject sells that exceed the current position quantity and prevent
  cash from going negative on buys.
- Fees are deducted from cash on buys and from proceeds on sells.

Integration:
- Backtester should rely on this model rather than a fixed "1 unit" approach.
- Live simulation loop should use the same model for consistency.

Testing:
- Buying reduces cash by price*qty plus fees and increases the position.
- Selling more than held is disallowed; valid sells reduce the position, update
  cash and record realized PnL.
- Portfolio equity equals cash plus the market value of all positions.
- Invariants: no leverage, cannot short, cannot sell unowned positions.

CLI wiring:
- `--trade-size` for default trade size (fractional allowed).
- Optional `--fee-bps` for trading fees. Flags documented in README/--help.
