# Issue #102: Portfolio Guardrails (Max DD Halt, Trade Cooldown)

---

Enforce monthly max drawdown and trade cooldowns to prevent cascades.

New: trading_bot/risk/guardrails.py

Rules:

Halt trading if month‑to‑date DD > max_dd_pct (e.g., 10%)

Cooldown X minutes after 3 consecutive losses

Integrate: guardrail checks at top of each loop; log & notify when active.

DoD: toggled via config.json or CLI; unit tests simulate threshold breach.
