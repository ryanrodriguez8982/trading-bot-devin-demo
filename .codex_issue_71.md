# Issue #71: Portfolio & Position model (cash-only, spot)

---

Implement portfolio and position model that tracks cash, positions per symbol, average cost, realized PnL, and equity. Provide buy and sell methods with fee handling and guards preventing selling more than held and negative cash. Integrate model into backtester and live loop. CLI accepts default trade size and fee_bps options. Add tests ensuring buys/sells update cash and positions correctly, equity calculation, and invariants (no leverage, cannot short, cannot sell unowned). Update README or --help flags documentation.
