# Issue #69: Portfolio & Position model (cash-only, spot)

---

Implement a Portfolio and Position model supporting spot-only trading:

- Track cash, positions per symbol, average cost, realized PnL, and equity.
- Methods: buy(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0), sell(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0).
- Guard against selling more than held or spending cash we don't have.
- Fees deducted from cash on buys and from proceeds on sells.

Integration:
- Backtester and live loop use this model for accounting.

Tests:
- Verify cash/position updates for buys and sells.
- Ensure cannot sell unowned or exceed holdings.
- Equity equals cash plus position value.

CLI wiring:
- Support --trade-size and --fee-bps flags.
