# Issue #64: Portfolio & Position model (cash-only, spot)

---

Implement a portfolio & position module supporting spot-only trading with the following features:
- Track cash balance (quote currency), per-symbol positions, average cost, realized PnL, and overall equity.
- Methods: `buy(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0)` and `sell(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0)`.
- Guard rails: disallow selling more than the held quantity; prevent cash from going negative (no leverage, no shorting).
- Fees: deducted from cash on buys and from proceeds on sells.
- Integration: backtester and live simulation should use this portfolio model instead of the previous ad-hoc logic.
- Tests verify cash/position updates, selling constraints, realized PnL, and equity calculations.
- CLI options to configure default trade size and optional fee basis points.
- Documentation/--help updates for new flags.
