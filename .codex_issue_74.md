# Issue #74: Portfolio & Position model (cash-only, spot)

---

Implement a Portfolio & Position model supporting spot-only trading. Track cash, positions per symbol with average cost, realized PnL, and equity. Provide methods `buy(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0)` and `sell(symbol, qty, price, fee_bps=0)` with guards: refuse sells if qty > position_qty; never reduce cash below zero. Fees deducted from cash on buys and from proceeds on sells.

Integration:
- Backtester uses this model instead of ad-hoc "1 unit" logic.
- Live loop (simulation mode) uses the same model for consistency.

Tests:
- Buying reduces cash by price*qty + fees and increases position.
- Selling disallows more than held; valid sells reduce position, update cash, record realized PnL.
- Portfolio equity = cash + Î£(position_qty * last_price).
- Invariants: no leverage, cannot short, cannot sell unowned.

CLI wiring:
- Configurable default trade_size (fractional allowed) and optional fee_bps parameter.
- Flags documented in README or --help.

Lint: repo passes flake8.

Keep current strategies intact; only refactor execution/accounting to use the new model.
