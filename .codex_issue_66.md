# Issue #66: Portfolio & Position model (cash-only, spot)

---

Implement a portfolio tracking cash and spot positions with buy/sell methods, fees, and equity calculation. Integrate with backtester and live loop. Include CLI flags for trade_size and fee_bps and tests verifying invariants (no leverage, no shorting, proper PnL).
